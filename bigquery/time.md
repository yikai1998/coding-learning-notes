```DATE_ADD```  
```DATE_SUB```  
*Special handling is required for MONTH, QUARTER, and YEAR parts when the date is at (or near) the last day of the month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original date's day, then the resulting date is the last date of that month.*

```FORMAT_DATE(format_string, date_expr)```

```LAST_DAY```  
Returns the last day from a date expression. This is commonly used to return the last day of the month.  

```PARSE_DATE```  
Converts a STRING value to a DATE value.  
```
-- This works because elements on both sides match.
SELECT PARSE_DATE('%A %b %e %Y', 'Thursday Dec 25 2008');

-- This produces an error because the year element is in different locations.
SELECT PARSE_DATE('%Y %A %b %e', 'Thursday Dec 25 2008');

-- This produces an error because one of the year elements is missing.
SELECT PARSE_DATE('%A %b %e', 'Thursday Dec 25 2008');

-- This works because %F can find all matching elements in date_string.
SELECT PARSE_DATE('%F', '2000-12-30');

SELECT PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', '20081225') AS parsed;
```
