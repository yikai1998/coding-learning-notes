# Introduction
"""
tqdm is a fast, extensible progress bar for Python and CLI (Command Line Interface).  
It's an open-source project that can be used to add a visual progress meter to loops and other iterative processes.  
It's particularly useful for long-running tasks where you want to give users feedback on the progress of the operation.

# Sample1
for i in tqdm(range(20), desc='processing'):
    time.sleep(1)


# Sample2 - cowork with Pools
def do_work(x):
    time.sleep(1)
    return x**x

        list(tqdm(p.imap(do_work, range(20)), total=len(range(20))))

While some scripts might work fine without the guard, it's considered best practice to include `if __name__ == "__main__": ` when:
 Defining or Creating Multiprocessing Pools: Always include this guard when your script uses the multiprocessing module, especially when defining pools or processing data in parallel, to ensure cross-platform compatibility and prevent execution issues.
 Writing Reusable Code or Libraries: Use it to prevent code from being executed unintentionally when your script is imported as a module in other scripts.
 Ensuring Clarity and Safety: Adding this guard helps clarify the execution entry point and ensure resource-intensive initialization only occurs when intended.

Here's a comparison of map, imap, and imap_unordered: 
map 
Synchronous Execution: map applies the given function to all items in the input iterable and returns a list of results. It waits for all tasks to complete before returning any results. 
Use Case: Best used when you need all results and don't need them in real-time. It's simple and straightforward for cases where you can afford to wait for all tasks to finish. 
Performance: May be slightly faster than imap because it can optimize the distribution of tasks since it knows the total number of tasks upfront. 

imap 
Asynchronous Execution: imap also applies the function to all items in the input iterable but returns an iterator. It yields results as soon as they are available, which allows for real-time processing. 
Use Case: Ideal for tasks where you want to process results as they come in, or when you want to display a progress bar (like with tqdm), or when you're dealing with a large number of tasks and don't want to wait for all of them to complete before starting to process the results. 
Memory Usage: Can be more memory-efficient than map because it doesn't need to store all results at once. 

imap_unordered 
Asynchronous Execution: Similar to imap, but it does not guarantee the order of results. It yields results as soon as they are available, but the order may not match the input order. 
Use Case: Best used when the order of results does not matter, and you want the benefits of asynchronous execution without the overhead of maintaining order. 
Performance: Often faster than imap because it doesn't need to manage the order of results, which can reduce synchronization overhead.

# Basic Parameters of tqdm
""" 
desc: A string to label the progress bar. 

total: The total number of iterations. If the loop is not known in advance, you can set it to None and update it later. 

unit: The unit of each iteration (e.g., 'it', 'batch', 'epoch'). 

unit_scale: Automatically determine the scale of total (e.g., adding 'k' for thousands). 

dynamic_ncols: Adjust the width of the bar based on the terminal window size. 

mininterval: The minimum update interval in seconds (e.e., 0.1 means the bar will update at least every 0.1 seconds). 

maxinterval: The maximum update interval in seconds. 

ncols: The width of the entire bar in columns. 

nrows: The height of the entire bar (for multi-line bars). 

ascii: The character set used to draw the bar (e.g., "#", "â–ˆ"). 

bar_format: A custom format for the bar string (e.g., {l_bar}{bar}| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}, {rate_fmt}]). 
""" 


""" 
pbar.update(n): This method is used to manually advance the progress bar by n steps. If you call pbar.update(2), it means you're indicating that 2 units of progress have been made since the last update.  

This is typically used in scenarios where the amount of work done in each iteration isn't uniform or when you want to manually control the progress bar's advancement.
